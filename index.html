            Let us step into the world of limited edition sneakers, where
            economics meets fashion. In this project, we will try to unravel the
            economic factors driving the pricing and demand for these
            sought-after kicks. And how these influences have given birth to a
            thriving secondary sneaker market, turning sneakers into more than
            just fashion items but also highly valuable collectives. We are also
            striving to know how the market exactly works and why it is so
            profitable. We are going to approach the biggest influences during
            our research; The media, providers and of course the target
            audience. When we decided on the topic, we thought about our
            interest and past research on sneakers, so then we just thought
            let’s do it!.

          <p>
            Sneaker conventions are developing as one of the most interesting
            aspects of this subculture. These conventions bring together
            sneakerheads, collectors, designers, and fans of all ages to
            celebrate and display their love of footwear. Sneaker conventions
            give collectors a place to show off their greatest treasures, a
            platform for businesses to release special partnerships and a venue
            for artists and designers to promote their custom creations. A live
            marketplace where you can buy, sell, and trade legitimate shoes is
            another way to think of sneaker conferences. You are welcome to
            bring your shoes to trade with, and the individuals running the
            booth can even certify your footwear to determine how much they will
            pay for it.

            As a result, we found out that if you want to gain more knowledge
            about buying, selling, and inspecting sneakers, you should attend
            one of these conventions. With over 50,000 sneakers on display,
            Sneakerness is the ultimate destination and our primary research
            location for the profile project. Sneakerness has now developed into
            Europe's largest sneaker festival, with conventions in cities such
            as Paris, Milan, and South Africa. That is why we chose to go to
            Sneakerness in Rotterdam. Sneakerness arose from the gathering of
            people who have a long-standing interest in sneakers. There is
            plenty to do at the event; for example, Sneakerness sells clothes,
            fashionable accessories, and shoe-cleaning supplies. You can also
            take part in other activities and personalize your footwear.
            Throughout the day, numerous DJs provide a calm atmosphere in the
            Van Nelle Factory. During the event, you can also get food and
            drinks from numerous stalls.

        We asked 100 people to fill in a survey to help us answer our
        sub-questions. Consumers mostly buy their shoes a few times a year,
        every six months, because they need to replace their old ones. When
        consumers buy their shoes, there is a high chance that they buy their
        shoes from the brand Nike in a black color. Consumers mostly have 1 to 5
        pairs of shoes, between €100 and €250. Even though there are a lot of
        sneakerheads, most haven’t been to a sneaker convention. Most consumers
        feel like they don’t directly follow sneaker trends. Most people think
        that the production price is between €50 and €100. This is sort of the
        same as our outcome because we found out that making a pair of shoes can
        cost $56.34. But even though the production prices are so low, people
        are still willing to pay between €250 and €500. Most people would also
        sell their most valuable shoes for €100 or €250. This means that most
        people still buy quite expensive shoes, knowing that the shoes are
        ‘overpriced’. Most people who were part of the survey also thought that
        resellers were the cause of the unfair sneaker prices.

            Factors Influencing the High Cost of Footwear Despite Inexpensive
            Production.

            Art of shoe pricing Footwear is a highly demanded product with a
            wide range of prices, from affordable to extravagant. While the
            production of many shoes may not be as expensive as the price of the
            shoes. This research delves into the factors responsible for this.
            We wanted to investigate the underlying factors that contribute to
            the high prices of certain shoes, despite relatively low production
            costs. By examining various aspects of the footwear industry, this
            study seeks to shed light on the reasons behind the price
            differentials in the market. The research relies on a combination of
            online resources, including industry reports and academic papers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To answer the (sub)question, “Why are some shoes so expensive, even
            though the production is cheap?” We used a combination of online
            resources and data analysis. After we searched for our information.
            We concluded that six main factors affect the price of the shoes on
            the market.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <h4>Brand and reputation </h4>Iconic sneaker brands like Nike and Adidas are
            often associated with quality, style, and exclusivity. For example,
            Nike's Air Jordan line is known for its quality and iconic style,
            and the brand's reputation for producing exclusive and stylish
            sneakers justifies their higher prices.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
           <h4> Marketing and promotion</h4> High-end sneaker brands invest significantly
            in marketing and promotion to create an image of desirability. For
            instance, Adidas collaborates with celebrities and designers on
            limited-edition releases, and their marketing campaigns frequently
            involve high-profile endorsements and unique storytelling. The costs
            associated with marketing and promotion contribute to consumers'
            final price for these exclusive and aspirational sneakers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
           <h4> Design and Innovation </h4>Sneakers with unique designs, innovative
            features, and high-quality materials typically come with premium
            price tags. Take, for example, the Nike Air Max series, known for
            its innovative Air cushioning technology. The unique design and
            technological innovation make these sneakers stand out and justify
            their higher cost.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <h4>Supply Chain Complexity</h4>When multiple intermediaries, such as
            distributors and retailers, are involved in the supply chain, it can
            add to the final price of sneakers. Luxury sneaker brands that are
            distributed through high-end retailers, like Balenciaga, often
            attract additional costs as each party takes a share of the profit,
            contributing to the overall expense.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
           <h4> Materials and craftsmanship</h4>Luxury sneakers are frequently made from
            premium materials like fine leather or exotic materials and are
            crafted with meticulous attention to detail. For instance, Common
            Projects is known for its minimalist, high-quality leather sneakers,
            and the use of top-notch materials and craftsmanship justifies its
            higher price.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <h4>Retail Markup </h4>
            Retailers add a markup to cover their operating expenses,
            including rent, and staff salaries, and to make a profit. When you
            purchase high-end sneakers from a boutique or a premium sneaker
            store. A portion of the price you pay goes toward covering the costs
            of the retail space and the salaries of the employees who provide
            you with a high-quality shopping experience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In conclusion, sneaker brands regularly charge higher prices due to
            their reputation for quality, marketing and promotion efforts,
            unique designs and innovative features, supply chain complexities,
            the use of premium materials, and retail markup. These factors
            contribute to the overall cost of luxury sneakers. By understanding
            these factors, consumers can make informed purchasing decisions, and
            businesses can optimize their pricing strategies.

        <div class="subtwo">   <h2>
            What are the costs of producing limited-edition shoes?
          </h2><br>
          <img src="src/image/sddefault.jpeg" width="300" height="200">
          </p>The cost of making limited edition sneakers can vary widely depending on several factors, including the brand, materials used, manufacturing processes, and the number of units produced. Limited edition sneakers are often made with higher-quality materials and may involve more complicated design and craftsmanship, which can drive up production costs.</p>
<br>
<p>
Most limited-edition shoes are made from the following materials; leather, textiles, synthetics, rubber, foam, and plastic. The most expensive material of them all is leather. Ehow says, “You can expect to use one and a half to two times that leather creating the uppers; thus, you should count on 3 square feet (0.28 m²)--nominally--to make a simple pair of costume shoes. Four is more likely.” Sneaker producers use calfskin leather for production. If you search for an average price for that type of leather, the average price will be $4.96 per square foot. So for one pair of sneakers, limited edition producers pay $19.84($4.96 × 4) for the materials.</p>
<br /><h4>Design and development </h4>
Designing and developing are external to the production, but can still have an influence on the price of limited edition sneakers. The price of making a prototype of limited edition sneakers is put into a table produced by the shoemaker academy. The table describes what a developer charges for every step of the design process.</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Design phase</th>
    <th>Cost</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mold of the shoe</td>
     <td>$0 – $750</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A pattern based on drawing</td>
    <td>$250 – $500</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>Outsole blueprint</td>
     <td>$150 – $600</td></tr>
         <tr><td>Solid model of the outsole</td>
      <td> $100 – $400 </td></tr>
       <tr><td>Prior sample pair</td>
      <td>$50 – $100</td></tr>
       <tr><td>Prototype pair</td>
      <td>$50 – $100</td></tr> 
        <tr> <td>Total</td>
        <td>$600-$2450</td></tr>
</table>



<br /><h4>Manufacturing location</h4>
Sneaker companies, such as Nike and Adidas, outsource production to more than one million workers in factories in China and other countries around the world, where the labor costs are relatively cheap, this helps to minimize manufacturing costs. 
For example, it costs Nike $28.50 to make one pair of shoes with a retail price of $100. An article in Investopedia says; “Nike's cost breakdown includes approximately $25 per pair for Chinese factory labor and overhead costs, plus $1 in shipping and $2.50 in duty costs.”
In recent years, rising costs of labor in China have impacted profit margins, and in response, some companies have moved their manufacturing operations to Vietnam, India, Indonesia, or Thailand. In addition, the big shoemakers are atomizing to reduce labor costs.</p>
<br /><h4>Production volume</h4>
A lot of sneaker brands produce very big quantities of sneakers but also throw unsold ones in landfills. An example of Han highly produced sneakers is the Air Jordan 1 next chapter, which has a rumored production of 73,000 pairs according to an article on si.com. For such a huge amount of shoes, the adult-sized shoes cost $200 on the Nike website when it was released. </p>
<br /><h4>Special features</h4>
Deals with star athletes and celebrities can help shoemakers sell sneakers at a higher price. If a celebrity is a face of the brand, the shoes will sell out faster at releases, because the shoes seem more exclusive. Celebrities like Kanye West and Micheal Jordan get profit from every pair sold. Kanye West gets 15% off every pair sold at first release, for example, the average Yeezy costs $220, so Kanye gets $33 per shoe that is being sold($220 x 0.15), but every time he promotes the shoes he also gets money from Adidas. Michael Jordan also gets 5% of Jordan’s earnings.</p>
<br /><h4>Marketing </h4>
Unpacking videos are viral on social media, brands pay a lot to influencers to make these videos, and they annually get $173 for making one YouTube video. But depending on followers, the lay on Instagram is from $75 to $3000 per post. But the highest pay is on Snapchat for $175 to $5000 per post depending on your views.</p>
<br />
<p>If you count the materials, manufacturing location, and special features, then the price of one pair of shoes would be $56.34. This means that those economic factors keep the price and production of the limited edition sneakers. However, the production volume, design development, and marketing make the shoes way more expensive because it makes limited edition sneakers more appealing and valuable to consumers. The complex interaction of these factors results in the diverse and often premium pricing of these sought-after foot wears. This results in the need for a second market where newer brands try to be more fair in the selling and producing of shoes for nature and consumers.</p>

          <div class="subthree"> <h2>The art and business of the concept reselling</h2>
          <br>
          <img src="src/image/download (9).jpeg">
          <p>
            Shoe reselling refers to the practice of buying sneakers at retail
            prices with the intention of reselling them at a higher price, often
            for a profit. This phenomenon has gained significant popularity in
            recent years, driven by the booming sneaker culture, limited-edition
            releases, and the rise of online marketplaces. The sneaker resale
            market has become a lucrative industry, with some highly
            sought-after pairs fetching prices far above their original retail
            value. Several factors contribute to the emergence and growth of the
            shoe reselling market:
          </p>
<br>
          <h4>Limited Editions and Hype Releases:</h4>
          <p>
            Sneaker brands frequently release limited-edition or exclusive
            designs that generate significant hype among sneaker enthusiasts.
            Limited availability and high demand create a resale market where
            individuals are willing to pay a premium to get their hands on these
            rare kicks.
          </p>
<br>
          <h4>Collaborations and Celebrity Endorsements:</h4>
          <p>
            Collaborations between sneaker brands and celebrities or designers
            can result in highly coveted and exclusive shoe releases. The
            association with a popular figure or brand can significantly
            increase the desirability of the sneakers, driving up resale prices.
          </p>
<br>
          <h4>Online Marketplaces:</h4>
          <p>
            The rise of online platforms and marketplaces has made it easier for
            individuals to buy and sell sneakers. Websites like StockX, GOAT,
            and eBay provide a platform for resellers to connect with potential
            buyers and establish market prices.
          </p>
<br>
          <h4>Sneaker Culture and Fashion Trends:</h4>
          <p>
            The cultural significance of sneakers has evolved beyond athletic
            footwear. Sneakers are now considered fashion statements, and people
            are willing to invest in unique and stylish designs. This cultural
            shift has fueled the demand for exclusive and limited-edition
            sneakers.
          </p>
<br>
          <h4>Investment Potential:</h4>
          <p>
            Some individuals view sneaker reselling as a form of investment.
            They anticipate that the value of certain limited-edition or rare
            sneakers will increase over time, allowing them to sell the shoes at
            a higher price in the future. However, the growth of the shoe
            reselling market has sparked debates about ethics and accessibility.
            Critics argue that the practice contributes to inflated prices,
            making it difficult for genuine sneaker enthusiasts to acquire the
            shoes they love at retail prices. Additionally, issues such as bot
            usage (automated programs that can quickly purchase limited-edition
            releases online) have led to increased difficulty for regular
            consumers to secure highly sought-after releases.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In conclusion, shoe reselling is a multifaceted phenomenon that has
            emerged as a result of the intersection of fashion, culture, and
            e-commerce. While it offers opportunities for entrepreneurial
            individuals to make a profit, it also raises questions about
            fairness, accessibility, and the impact on the broader sneaker
            community

Brand loyalty and expanding their customer base can be achieved with this, by companies and resellers. If prices are not affordable, customers will look for affordable alternatives.

<br><h4>Market Competition</h4>
 <p>Competition in the sneaker market can be the reason for some providers to set lower prices to attract more customers. Lower pricing can be a strategy to gain a competitive edge over other brands or resellers. It’s also important for resellers to take in consideration that the sneakers that they are reselling can be a seasonal “must have” piece.</p>
        <br><h4>Production Costs</h4>
 <p>The cost of producing sneakers can be different per brand, and some brands may have more efficient production processes or sourcing methods, allowing them to offer limited editions at a lower price. For example, automizing instead of hand work.</p>
      <br><h4>Marketing Objectives</h4>
 <p>Brands may be more attracted to other marketing objectives over maximizing profits on limited edition releases. They might use these releases to generate buzz, build hype, or create brand awareness on social media, even if it means lower profit margins. Some resellers use a strategy of quickly selling sneakers to have more profit, that means that they are not prioritizing their individual sales but their quantity.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Supply</h4> 
 <p>The shortage of limited edition sneakers can drive up their resale value, which some providers may want to avoid. Because the demand being higher than the supply, brands sometimes differ accessibility of their products. For example, a lot of the resellers at Sneakerness only sold certain shoes at the event. This ensures their products end up in the hands of genuine enthusiasts rather than being resold for exorbitant prices. </p>
 <br>
<p>To summarize, providers intend to cheapen their prices to avoid driving up resale values. This ensures that the shoes get into the hands of genuine enthusiasts, rather than becoming products that are being sold at extravagant prices, leading to a secondary market of the knock-offs. Essentially, the choice to adopt a more affordable pricing strategy is a clever way influenced by combining brand strategy, market dynamics, production efficiency, and long-term marketing goals.</p>
